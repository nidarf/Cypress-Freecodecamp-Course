This is Cypress QA automation practices. I did testing on [nextjs applications created by Ryan Solomon](https://github.com/coderyansolomon/cypress-course.git).

## Getting Started

First, clone repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nidarf/Cypress-Freecodecamp-Course.git
```

Go to Cypress-Freecodecamp-Course folder

```bash
cd Cypress-Freecodecamp-Course
```

Second, install depedencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Third, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Fourth, open new terminal and open cypress

```bash
npx cypress open
```

Fifth, choose E2E testing and your preferred browser for testing

Lastly, click specs one by one to run the end to end testing.
